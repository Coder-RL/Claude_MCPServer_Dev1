# DEFINITIVE MCP FUNCTIONAL TESTS

## CONFIRMED: All 3 MCP servers start successfully based on logs

### Server Status from Logs:
- ‚úÖ **filesystem-standard**: "Secure MCP Filesystem Server running on stdio"
- ‚úÖ **enhanced-memory**: "Enhanced Memory MCP Server (STDIO) running on stdio" + PostgreSQL connected
- ‚úÖ **sequential-thinking**: "Sequential Thinking MCP Server running on stdio"

## EXACT TESTS TO PERFORM IN CLAUDE CODE

### 1. Launch Claude Code
```bash
claude --mcp-config /Users/robertlee/GitHubProjects/Claude_MCPServer/working_test_results/claude_mcp_config.json
```

### 2. Test Each Server

#### üóÇÔ∏è FILESYSTEM TEST
**Command**: "Use the filesystem tools to list files in the current directory"
**Expected**: 
- Claude should use `mcp__filesystem-standard__list_directory`
- Should return actual file listing
- No "tool not found" errors

**Follow-up**: "Create a file named mcp_test_success.txt with the content 'MCP filesystem working'"
**Expected**:
- Should use `mcp__filesystem-standard__write_file`
- File should be created successfully

#### üß† MEMORY TEST  
**Command**: "Store in memory with key 'functional_test' and value 'MCP memory test successful at [current time]'"
**Expected**:
- Claude should use `mcp__memory-simple-user__store_memory`
- Should confirm storage successful

**Follow-up**: "Retrieve the memory with key 'functional_test'"
**Expected**:
- Should use `mcp__memory-simple-user__retrieve_memory`
- Should return the stored value

#### ü§î SEQUENTIAL THINKING TEST
**Command**: "Use sequential thinking to analyze: What are the key steps to set up a CI/CD pipeline?"
**Expected**:
- Claude should use sequential thinking tools
- Should provide structured, step-by-step analysis
- Should be noticeably more structured than normal responses

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### ‚úÖ PROOF OF FUNCTIONALITY:
1. **Tool Names**: Claude specifically mentions "mcp__" prefixed tool names
2. **No Errors**: No "tool not found" or "server unavailable" messages  
3. **Actual Results**: Each test produces functional responses from the servers
4. **File Creation**: The filesystem test actually creates the test file
5. **Memory Persistence**: Store and retrieve operations work correctly
6. **Sequential Structure**: Sequential thinking shows clear step-by-step reasoning

### ‚ùå FAILURE INDICATORS:
- Generic responses without MCP tool mentions
- "Tool not found" errors
- No file creation in filesystem test
- Memory operations failing
- Sequential thinking not showing structured approach

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

After testing, run these to verify:
```bash
# Check if file was created
ls -la mcp_test_success.txt

# Check server processes (if needed)  
pgrep -f "mcp" | wc -l

# Check logs for errors
grep -i error /Users/robertlee/GitHubProjects/Claude_MCPServer/working_test_results/*.log
```

## EXPECTED OUTCOME

If this test passes, it proves:
1. ‚úÖ Claude Code can connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously
2. ‚úÖ All 3 types of MCP servers work (official NPX + custom Node.js)
3. ‚úÖ Functional interaction occurs (not just connection)
4. ‚úÖ STDIO transport works correctly for all server types
5. ‚úÖ No artificial connection limits in Claude Code
