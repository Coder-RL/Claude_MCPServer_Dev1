## üéì LESSONS LEARNED (Session 2025-05-25)

### **Technical Insights**:
1. **CWD Parameter Issue**: Claude Code MCP client cannot handle working directory parameters
2. **Configuration Patterns**: Working servers follow specific patterns (absolute paths, no cwd)
3. **Debug Methodology**: `claude --mcp-debug` provides critical startup diagnostics
4. **Server Architecture**: Official MCP SDK patterns (Server + StdioServerTransport) most reliable

### **Development Process**:
1. **Research First**: Vetted solutions from Stack Overflow/GitHub reduce development risk
2. **Systematic Testing**: Individual server testing before integration prevents complex debugging
3. **Evidence-Based Fixes**: Debug logs provide concrete evidence for configuration issues
4. **Documentation Critical**: Comprehensive session documentation enables future development

### **Project Management**:
1. **Clear Objectives**: Specific goals (6 optimization techniques) enable focused development
2. **Validation Requirements**: End-to-end testing validates implementation completeness
3. **Configuration Management**: Changes to global configuration require careful tracking
4. **Session Documentation**: Detailed session records enable project continuity

## üÜò RISK MITIGATION

### **High Risk Items**:
- **MCP Integration Failure**: Enhanced memory system works individually but may not integrate with Claude Code
- **Performance Degradation**: 6 optimization techniques may introduce latency
- **Configuration Drift**: Multiple configuration files may become inconsistent
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Version compatibility issues may emerge over time

### **Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each component before full integration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Establish baseline metrics and monitor changes
- **Configuration Management**: Centralize and version control all configurations
- **Dependency Pinning**: Lock dependency versions to prevent conflicts

## üìû NEXT SESSION HANDOFF

### **Immediate Actions Required**:
1. **Run `/mcp` command** to validate all 11 servers are now connected
2. **Test enhanced memory tools** through Claude Code interface
3. **Document actual performance improvements** from enhanced memory system
4. **Plan next development phase** based on validation results

### **Decision Points**:
- If MCP integration successful ‚Üí Proceed to production testing and performance validation
- If MCP integration still failing ‚Üí Additional debugging required, may need alternative approaches
