## üß† STEP 3: Test Enhanced Memory System (Priority #1)

### Test 3.1: Store Enhanced Memory
**Ask Claude**: 
```
Store this in enhanced memory with high importance: "I prefer TypeScript with strict type checking and comprehensive error handling. My coding style emphasizes clean architecture, proper typing, and extensive documentation."
```

**Expected**: Success message showing all 6 optimization techniques applied

### Test 3.2: Retrieve Optimized Context
**Ask Claude**:
```
Retrieve my coding preferences from enhanced memory using optimization techniques
```

**Expected**: Hierarchical retrieval with compression statistics

### Test 3.3: Memory Optimization Stats
**Ask Claude**:
```
Show me enhanced memory optimization statistics and performance metrics
```

**Expected**: Detailed stats on compression ratios, technique effectiveness

---

## üìä STEP 4: Test Data Analytics Servers

### Test 4.1: Data Pipeline
**Ask Claude**:
```
Create a data pipeline to process CSV files from /tmp/input to PostgreSQL analytics database
```

**Expected**: Pipeline configuration with ETL steps

### Test 4.2: Real-time Analytics  
**Ask Claude**:
```
Set up a real-time analytics stream for monitoring system metrics with 5-minute windows
```

**Expected**: Stream configuration with processing windows

### Test 4.3: Data Warehouse
**Ask Claude**:
```
Query the analytics data warehouse to get user activity summary for the last 30 days
```

**Expected**: SQL query execution plan

### Test 4.4: ML Deployment
**Ask Claude**:
```
Register a new classification model called "user_sentiment" with 95% accuracy using TensorFlow
```

**Expected**: Model registration with deployment endpoint

### Test 4.5: Data Governance
**Ask Claude**:
```
Register a new data asset called "user_interactions" with internal classification and assess its data quality
```

**Expected**: Asset registration with governance metrics

---

## üîí STEP 5: Test Security & Development Servers

### Test 5.1: Security Vulnerability Scan
**Ask Claude**:
```
Scan this project for security vulnerabilities including dependency checks and static analysis
```

**Expected**: Comprehensive security report with findings

### Test 5.2: UI Design Analysis
**Ask Claude**:
```
Analyze the design system of this project and check for accessibility compliance
```

**Expected**: Design consistency report with recommendations

### Test 5.3: Performance Optimization
**Ask Claude**:
```
Profile the performance of this application and identify potential bottlenecks
```

**Expected**: Performance analysis with optimization suggestions

---

## üßÆ STEP 6: Test Memory & Reasoning Servers

### Test 6.1: Simple Memory Storage
**Ask Claude**:
```
Store in simple memory: key="project_status" value="MCP servers fully operational" tags=["status", "mcp"]
```

**Expected**: Successful memory storage confirmation

### Test 6.2: Sequential Thinking
**Ask Claude**:
```
Use sequential thinking to analyze the best approach for scaling this MCP server ecosystem
```

**Expected**: Step-by-step reasoning process

---

## üìã STEP 7: Comprehensive Tool Listing

**Ask Claude**:
```
List all available MCP tools across all connected servers
```

**Expected**: 50+ tools listed from all 11 servers including:
- Enhanced memory tools (3)
- Data analytics tools (21)
- Security tools (6)
- Design tools (8)
- Memory tools (5)
- Reasoning tools (1)
- Optimization tools (5+)

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Server Connection Test
- [ ] All 11 servers show "connected" in `/mcp` command
- [ ] No "failed" servers in the list
- [ ] Enhanced-memory server appears in the list

### Functionality Tests  
- [ ] Enhanced memory stores and retrieves with 6 optimization techniques
- [ ] Data analytics servers create pipelines, streams, queries
- [ ] Security server scans and reports vulnerabilities
- [ ] UI design server analyzes design systems
- [ ] Memory servers store and retrieve data
- [ ] Sequential thinking server provides reasoning

### Integration Tests

---

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### If servers show "failed":
1. Check Docker containers: `docker ps`
2. Restart infrastructure: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
3. Test individual servers: `timeout 3 npx tsx servers/memory/src/enhanced-memory-final.ts`

### If tools don't respond:
1. Check configuration: `jq '.mcpServers | keys' ~/.claude/claude_code_config.json`
2. Verify absolute paths in config
3. Restart Claude Code completely

### If enhanced-memory missing:
1. Verify config includes enhanced-memory server
2. Test standalone: `echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list"}' | npx tsx servers/memory/src/enhanced-memory-final.ts`
