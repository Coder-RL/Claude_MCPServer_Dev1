# Claude Code MCP Server Connection Solution

## Problem Analysis
Based on research from Stack Overflow and GitHub issues, the main problems are:
1. **Tool name validation errors** - API Error 400 with tool names not matching pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`
2. **Protocol version validation issues** - stdio servers missing protocolVersion field
3. **Path inconsistencies** - mixing npx with direct node paths causes failures
4. **Configuration conflicts** - multiple config files with different server definitions

## Root Cause
Your enhanced memory server tools have names that follow the correct pattern, but the connection is failing due to configuration inconsistencies and path issues.

## Solution

### 1. Use the Fixed Configuration
Replace your Claude Code configuration with:
```bash
cp /Users/robertlee/GitHubProjects/Claude_MCPServer/config/claude-code/claude_code_config_fixed.json ~/.config/claude-code/claude_code_config.json
```

### 2. Key Fixes Applied:
- **Consistent Node Paths**: All commands use full node/npx paths from nvm
- **Tool Name Validation**: Enhanced memory server already has compliant tool names
- **Environment Variables**: Added NODE_ENV for production stability
- **Working Directory**: Specified cwd for tsx execution

### 3. Server Details:

#### Enhanced Memory Server (Primary)
- **Tools**: `store_enhanced_memory`, `retrieve_optimized_context`, `get_optimization_stats`
- **Features**: 6 optimization techniques including context compression and sliding window
- **Path**: Uses npx tsx for TypeScript execution

#### Memory Simple User (Backup)
- **Tools**: Basic memory operations
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing Claude Desktop setup

#### Sequential Thinking
- **Official MCP Server**: Proven to work with Claude Code
- **Installation**: Uses npx with official package

### 4. Troubleshooting Commands:

Test individual servers:
```bash
# Test enhanced memory (should timeout waiting for stdio - this is correct)
timeout 5s npx tsx /Users/robertlee/GitHubProjects/Claude_MCPServer/servers/memory/src/enhanced-memory-final.ts

# Test simple memory
timeout 5s node /Users/robertlee/GitHubProjects/Claude_MCPServer/mcp/memory/simple-server.js

# Test sequential thinking
timeout 5s npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
```

### 5. Verification Steps:
1. Stop any running MCP processes: `pkill -f "simple-server\|enhanced-memory"`
2. Replace config file with fixed version
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Check `mcp` command shows all 3 servers as connected

## Edge Cases Addressed:
- **Node version conflicts**: Uses specific nvm node path
- **TypeScript execution**: Uses npx tsx instead of direct node
- **Environment isolation**: Separate env vars for each server
- **Path resolution**: Absolute paths prevent working directory issues

## Expected Result:
All 3 MCP servers should connect successfully with Claude Code, giving you access to:
- Enhanced memory with 6 optimization techniques
- Simple memory for basic operations  
- Sequential thinking for reasoning chains
