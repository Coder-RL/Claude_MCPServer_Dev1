## ✅ CRITICAL CONFIGURATION ISSUE RESOLVED - May 26, 2025

### Configuration Management Crisis - COMPLETE RESOLUTION
During Week 11 completion, a **critical configuration management issue** was discovered and **FULLY RESOLVED**:

**Original Problem**: Multiple conflicting MCP configuration files causing persistent `memory-simple-user` connections despite removal attempts.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- 13 project files containing `memory-simple` references
- Non-standard `claude_code_config*.json` files (not in official docs)
- Project-scoped `.mcp.json` overriding user-scoped configuration
- Multiple conflicting settings files

### ✅ RESOLUTION COMPLETED - May 26, 2025

**Final Solution Implemented**: Complete deletion of all non-standard configuration files

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ **Deleted 13 problematic project files** - Eliminated all non-standard configs
2. ✅ **Consolidated to single settings file** - `~/.claude/settings.json` only
3. ✅ **Added 11 production MCP servers** - Complete enterprise-grade MCP setup
4. ✅ **Updated permissions** - All servers properly configured in user scope
5. ✅ **Verified clean configuration** - Standards-compliant setup achieved

**Current MCP Server Configuration (11 total)**:
1. memory-enhanced, 2. data-pipeline, 3. data-governance, 4. sequential-thinking, 5. filesystem-standard, 6. realtime-analytics, 7. data-warehouse, 8. ml-deployment, 9. security-vulnerability, 10. optimization, 11. ui-design

**Startup Command**: `claude` (standard startup, no custom configs)

**Documentation**: Complete troubleshooting guide updated at `docs/CONFIGURATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

**Impact**: ✅ **Week 12 development unblocked** - Clean development environment ready

### Configuration Standards Established
1. **User-scoped MCP configuration only** - No project configs
2. **Single settings file** - `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. **Standard startup** - `claude` command
4. **11 production MCP servers** - Enterprise-ready capability
