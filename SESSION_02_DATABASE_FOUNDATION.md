# Session 02: Database Foundation

**Date:** January 20, 2025  
**Session Focus:** PostgreSQL 16 + Redis foundation with enterprise-grade patterns  
**Phase:** 1 - Foundation, Week 2

## Objectives
- [ ] Create PostgreSQL connection pool with proper error handling and monitoring
- [ ] Implement Redis client with connection management and failover
- [ ] Design and implement database schemas for all 7 MCP servers
- [ ] Create versioned migration system following best practices
- [ ] Build TypeScript models and interfaces with full type safety
- [ ] Set up database seeding and testing utilities

## Database Architecture Design

### Schema Isolation Strategy
Each MCP server gets its own PostgreSQL schema for:
- **Data isolation** - Clear boundaries between services
- **Independent evolution** - Schemas can evolve separately
- **Security** - Granular permissions per service
- **Maintenance** - Independent backup/restore capabilities

### Schemas to Implement
1. `inference_enhancement` - Vector embeddings, knowledge graphs
2. `ui_testing` - Screenshots, comparisons, test results
3. `analytics` - Datasets, visualizations, analysis results  
4. `code_quality` - Analysis reports, vulnerabilities, metrics
5. `documentation` - Projects, documents, generated content
6. `memory_management` - Contexts, embeddings, hierarchies
7. `web_access` - Cache, search history, API usage tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Connection Pool Strategy
- **Primary Pool:** PostgreSQL with connection limits and health monitoring
- **Cache Pool:** Redis with cluster support and failover
- **Error Handling:** Circuit breakers and exponential backoff
- **Monitoring:** Connection metrics and performance tracking

### Migration System Design
- **Version Control:** Sequential numbered migrations
- **Rollback Support:** Down migrations for every up migration  
- **Lock Mechanism:** Prevent concurrent migrations
- **Validation:** Schema consistency checks

## Best Practices Applied
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage for all DB operations
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error types and recovery strategies
- **Performance:** Optimized queries, proper indexing, connection pooling
- **Security:** Prepared statements, input validation, least privilege
- **Monitoring:** Logging, metrics, health checks throughout

## Session Progress

### ✅ Completed Tasks
1. **PostgreSQL Connection Pool** - Enterprise-grade with:
   - Connection pooling with configurable limits
   - Health checks and connection monitoring  
   - Comprehensive error handling and recovery
   - Transaction support with automatic rollback
   - Graceful shutdown handling

2. **Redis Client Manager** - Production-ready with:
   - Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Command execution tracking and metrics
   - JSON serialization helpers
   - Pub/Sub support for messaging
   - Connection health monitoring

3. **Shared Logging System** - Structured logging with:
   - Configurable log levels and outputs
   - Structured JSON logging support
   - Child logger creation with context
   - Environment-based configuration

4. **Complete Database Schemas** - All 7 MCP servers:
   - `inference_enhancement` - Vector embeddings (pgvector), knowledge graphs
   - `ui_testing` - Screenshots, visual comparisons, accessibility reports  
   - `analytics` - Datasets, visualizations, predictions, patterns
   - `code_quality` - Static analysis, vulnerabilities, refactoring suggestions
   - `documentation` - Projects, documents, API specs, diagrams
   - `memory_management` - Context storage, embeddings, hierarchical memory
   - `web_access` - Cache, search history, API usage, screenshots

5. **Migration System** - Production-grade with:
   - Lock mechanism to prevent concurrent migrations
   - Checksum validation for migration integrity
   - Transaction-based execution with rollback
   - Status tracking and reporting
   - CLI interface for operations

### Database Architecture Features
- **Schema Isolation** - Each MCP server has dedicated schema
- **Advanced Indexing** - Optimized for query performance
- **Vector Support** - pgvector extension for AI embeddings
- **JSONB Storage** - Flexible metadata and configuration storage
- **Audit Trails** - Created/updated timestamps throughout
- **Referential Integrity** - Proper foreign keys and constraints

### Performance Optimizations
- **Connection Pooling** - Reuse database connections efficiently
- **Vector Indexes** - IVFFlat indexes for embedding similarity search
- **GIN Indexes** - Fast JSONB queries for metadata
- **Composite Indexes** - Multi-column indexes for common queries

### Security Features
- **Prepared Statements** - SQL injection prevention
- **Least Privilege** - Schema-level access control
- **Input Validation** - Type safety and constraints
- **Error Sanitization** - No sensitive data in logs

## Session Status
- **Status:** COMPLETED ✅  
- **Phase 1 Week 2:** Database Foundation - COMPLETED
- **Next Session:** Phase 1 Week 3 - Core Orchestration Components
