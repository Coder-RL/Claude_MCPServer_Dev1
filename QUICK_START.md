# üöÄ QUICK START - Ready for Week 12 Development

## üîç FIRST: Verify Current State (30 seconds)

**BEFORE doing anything else:**
```bash
# 1. Quick verification
cat VERIFY_CURRENT_STATE.md

# 2. Run the 30-second verification
# Follow the steps in VERIFY_CURRENT_STATE.md
```

**Expected state:**
- ‚úÖ Week 11 complete, ‚úÖ Configuration crisis RESOLVED, ‚úÖ Week 12 READY  
- ‚úÖ Enhanced from 5 to 11 production MCP servers  
- ‚úÖ Clean, standards-compliant user-scoped setup  

## Start Development (after verification passes)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /Users/robertlee/GitHubProjects/Claude_MCPServer

# 2. Start Claude Code (standard startup)
claude

# 3. Verify MCP servers (should show 11 servers)
# Run this inside Claude Code session: mcp
```

## Verify Success

**Check MCP status - should show 11 servers:**
```bash
mcp
```

**Expected output:**
```
MCP Server Status
‚Ä¢ data-governance: connected
‚Ä¢ data-pipeline: connected
‚Ä¢ data-warehouse: connected
‚Ä¢ filesystem-standard: connected  
‚Ä¢ memory-enhanced: connected
‚Ä¢ ml-deployment: connected
‚Ä¢ optimization: connected
‚Ä¢ realtime-analytics: connected
‚Ä¢ security-vulnerability: connected
‚Ä¢ sequential-thinking: connected
‚Ä¢ ui-design: connected
```

**‚úÖ SUCCESS: 11 production MCP servers running**
**‚ùå If you see `memory-simple-user` - restart Claude Code to clear cache**

## Resume Development

**Week 12 Ready - Begin Advanced AI Integration:**
```bash
# Check Week 12 plan
cat docs/WEEK_12_PLAN.md

# Begin Week 12 implementation
npm run start:week-12
```

## If You're a New Developer

**Mandatory sequence (do NOT skip steps):**
1. **Read this file first** (you're here) ‚úÖ
2. **üö® VERIFY STATE** (run `VERIFY_CURRENT_STATE.md` steps) ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
3. **Only if verification passes**: Start Claude Code with commands above
4. **Check overall progress**: `cat PROGRESS.md` 
5. **Understand current state**: `cat ASSESSMENT.md`
6. **Continue development**: Follow Week 12 plan

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Do NOT skip step 2 verification. If verification fails, troubleshoot first.
