# Session 03: Core Orchestration Components

**Date:** January 20, 2025  
**Session Focus:** Service Registry, Message Bus, and Resource Management  
**Phase:** 1 - Foundation, Week 3

## Objectives
- [ ] Implement Service Registry using etcd for centralized service management
- [ ] Create Message Bus with Redis Streams for inter-service communication  
- [ ] Build Resource Management system for dynamic allocation and monitoring
- [ ] Implement Service Discovery mechanisms for automatic service detection
- [ ] Create orchestration server core with health monitoring and APIs
- [ ] Establish workflow foundations for multi-service coordination

## Orchestration Architecture Design

### Service Registry Strategy
Using etcd as the single source of truth for:
- **Service Registration** - Automatic registration with health checks
- **Configuration Management** - Centralized config with versioning
- **Leader Election** - For distributed coordination
- **Watch Capabilities** - Real-time service state changes

### Message Bus Architecture
Redis Streams for:
- **Event-Driven Communication** - Asynchronous service messaging
- **Message Persistence** - Reliable delivery with replay capability
- **Consumer Groups** - Load balancing and fault tolerance
- **Dead Letter Queues** - Failed message handling

### Resource Management Design
- **Dynamic Allocation** - CPU, memory, and connection limits per service
- **Load Balancing** - Request distribution across service instances
- **Circuit Breakers** - Fault tolerance and cascade failure prevention
- **Metrics Collection** - Real-time performance monitoring

## Technical Implementation

### Service Registry Features
- **Health Checks** - Periodic service health validation
- **TTL Management** - Automatic cleanup of dead services
- **Service Metadata** - Capabilities, versions, and configurations
- **Notification System** - Real-time service state changes

### Message Bus Capabilities
- **Guaranteed Delivery** - At-least-once message processing
- **Message Ordering** - Sequential processing when required
- **Fan-out Patterns** - Broadcast to multiple consumers
- **Rate Limiting** - Message throughput controls

## Best Practices Applied
- **High Availability** - Multi-node etcd cluster support
- **Error Resilience** - Comprehensive retry and fallback strategies
- **Performance** - Efficient connection pooling and caching
- **Security** - Authentication, authorization, and encryption
- **Observability** - Detailed metrics, logging, and tracing

## Session Progress
- **Status:** Starting
- **Current Task:** Service Registry with etcd implementation
- **Next:** Message Bus with Redis Streams
