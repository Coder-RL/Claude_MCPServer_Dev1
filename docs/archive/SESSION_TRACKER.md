## Current Status
- **Active Phase:** ARCHITECTURE CRISIS RESOLUTION
- **Critical Issue:** BaseMCPServer hybrid architecture violates MCP protocol
- **Current Priority:** Fix STDIO/HTTP transport confusion before proceeding
- **Impact:** 30+ servers inherit broken hybrid architecture from BaseMCPServer
- **Next Milestone:** Create PureMCPServer with pure STDIO architecture

## Key Decisions Log
1. **2025-01-20:** Project named `Claude_MCPServer`
2. **2025-01-20:** Location set to `/Users/robertlee/GitHubProjects/Claude_MCPServer`
3. **2025-01-20:** Following comprehensive development plan with clean coding principles
4. **Architecture Crisis:** BaseMCPServer tries to be both STDIO and HTTP simultaneously
5. **Root Cause:** Memory-simple server using STDIO transport but started as HTTP server
6. **Solution:** Create PureMCPServer class with pure STDIO architecture

## Notes
- Using session-based tracking for better organization
- Implementing best practices and clean coding principles throughout
- **CRITICAL**: Must fix architecture before proceeding with development
- BaseMCPServer violates MCP protocol requirements (STDIO vs HTTP confusion)
- Claude Desktop/Code require pure STDIO transport, not HTTP servers
- All data analytics servers inherit this broken architecture pattern
