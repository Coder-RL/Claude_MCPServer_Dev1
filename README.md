# Claude MCP Server Ecosystem

A comprehensive 33-week development plan to build enterprise-grade Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## üéØ Current Status: Week 11 COMPLETED ‚úÖ

**Progress: 11/33 weeks (33% complete)**

We are building a complete MCP server ecosystem with 5 specialized servers per week. Week 11 focused on **Data Management and Analytics**.

## üìä Project Overview

This project implements a systematic 33-week plan to create production-ready MCP servers covering:
- Core infrastructure (Weeks 1-5) ‚úÖ
- Specialized servers (Weeks 6-11) ‚úÖ 
- Advanced capabilities (Weeks 12-33) üöß

Each week delivers 5 complete, integrated MCP servers with:
- Full TypeScript implementation
- Comprehensive testing
- Health monitoring
- Production-ready features

```

## üìã Week 11 Accomplishments

**Data Management and Analytics Server** - 5 Complete Components:

1. **Advanced Data Pipeline Processing** (`data-pipeline.ts`)
   - Multi-source data ingestion (files, databases, APIs, streams)
   - Transformation engine with validation
   - Error handling and monitoring
   - **MCP Tools**: `register_data_source`, `create_pipeline`, `execute_pipeline`

2. **Real-time Analytics & Streaming** (`realtime-analytics.ts`) 
   - Multi-protocol streaming (Kafka, Redis, WebSocket, MQTT)
   - Real-time windowing and aggregation
   - Alert systems and dashboards
   - **MCP Tools**: `create_stream`, `start_stream`, `get_stream_metrics`

3. **Data Warehouse Integration** (`data-warehouse.ts`)
   - Multi-platform support (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery)
   - ETL orchestration and scheduling
   - Performance optimization
   - **MCP Tools**: `register_warehouse`, `create_etl_job`, `execute_etl_job`

4. **ML Model Deployment** (`ml-deployment.ts`)
   - Multi-framework support (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
   - Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling)
   - Auto-scaling and monitoring
   - **MCP Tools**: `register_model`, `deploy_model`, `predict`

5. **Data Governance & Quality** (`data-governance.ts`)
   - Asset classification and lineage
   - Quality assessment and compliance
   - Access monitoring and policies
   - **MCP Tools**: `register_data_asset`, `assess_data_quality`, `trace_data_lineage`

## üéØ Next Steps: Week 12

**Focus**: Advanced AI Integration Server
**Components**: Model orchestration, ensemble methods, AutoML, neural architecture search, AI ops

### To Continue Development:
```bash
# Setup Week 12 structure
npm run setup:week-12

# View Week 12 requirements
cat docs/WEEK_12_PLAN.md

# Start Week 12 implementation
npm run start:week-12
```

## üìù Development Workflow

### Adding New Components:
1. Define MCP server class extending `BaseServer`
2. Implement required MCP tools and routes
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Include performance monitoring
5. Write integration tests
6. Update documentation

### Testing Strategy:
```bash
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests
npm run test:integration  # Component integration
npm run test:e2e          # End-to-end workflows
npm run test:performance  # Load testing
```
