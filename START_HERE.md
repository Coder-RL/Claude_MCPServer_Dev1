# üöÄ START HERE - MCP Project Status & Next Steps

**Date**: May 26, 2025  
**Status**: 10 MCP servers configured globally, ready for end-to-end testing  
**Next Action**: Verify functionality with new Claude Code session

---

## üìä **CURRENT PROJECT STATE**

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED:**
1. **Global MCP Configuration**: 10 servers configured in `~/.claude/claude_code_config.json`
2. **STDIO Conversion**: All servers converted to STDIO transport (required by Claude Code)
3. **Issue Documentation**: Critical global config vs local config issue documented
4. **Test Framework**: Comprehensive end-to-end tests created

### **üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP:**
**Prove the 10 MCP servers work end-to-end with Claude Code**

---

## üî¨ **EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE**

### **What We've Discovered:**
- Claude Code can connect to 10+ MCP servers simultaneously (no connection limit found)
- The "connecting..." status is a false positive - servers actually work
- Two critical issues repeatedly cause problems:
  1. **Global vs Local Config**: Must use global config or lose servers when changing directories
  2. **STDIO vs HTTP**: Must use STDIO transport or Claude Code can't connect

### **What We've Built:**
- **10 Working MCP Servers** (confirmed via logs showing "running on stdio")
- **Global Configuration** at `~/.claude/claude_code_config.json`
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** to verify end-to-end functionality

### **What We Need to Prove:**
- That Claude Code can actually USE these servers (not just connect)
- That each server responds to functional requests
- That all servers work simultaneously

---

## üß™ **IMMEDIATE TESTING REQUIRED**

### **Step 1: Verify Global Config**
```bash
# Check global config exists and has 10 servers:
cat ~/.claude/claude_code_config.json | grep -c '"command"'
# Expected output: 10
```

### **Step 2: Start New Claude Code Session**
```bash
# Exit current session (if in one) and restart:
claude --mcp-config ~/.claude/claude_code_config.json
```

### **Step 3: Test Each MCP Server**

**Test 1 - Memory Server:**
```
Command: "Store in memory: key='test_functional' value='MCP working on May 26'"
Expected: Claude uses mcp__memory-simple__store_memory tool
Then: "Retrieve memory with key 'test_functional'"
Expected: Returns the stored value
```

**Test 2 - Sequential Thinking:**
```
Command: "Use sequential thinking to analyze: How to deploy a web application?"
Expected: Claude uses sequential thinking tools, provides structured analysis
```

**Test 3 - Data Pipeline:**
```
Command: "Use data pipeline tools to show available operations"
Expected: Claude uses mcp__data-pipeline__ tools
```

**Continue for all 10 servers...**

### **Step 4: Verify Success**
```bash
# After testing, check if test file was created:
ls -la test_*.txt
# Should show files created by filesystem operations
```

---

## üìã **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **‚úÖ PROOF OF SUCCESS:**
1. **Tool Usage**: Claude specifically mentions "mcp__[server-name]__[tool]" in responses
2. **No Errors**: No "tool not found" or "server unavailable" messages
3. **Functional Results**: Each test produces real results from the servers
4. **All 10 Servers**: Every configured server responds to requests

### **‚ùå FAILURE INDICATORS:**
- Generic responses without specific MCP tool mentions
- "Tool not found" errors
- No functional operations (file creation, memory storage, etc.)

## üèóÔ∏è **THE 10 CONFIGURED SERVERS**

From `~/.claude/claude_code_config.json`:

1. **memory-simple**: Store/retrieve data persistently
2. **sequential-thinking**: Structured step-by-step reasoning  
3. **data-pipeline**: Data processing and transformation
4. **realtime-analytics**: Real-time data analysis
5. **data-warehouse**: Data warehouse operations
6. **ml-deployment**: Machine learning model deployment
7. **data-governance**: Data compliance and governance
8. **security-vulnerability**: Security scanning and analysis
9. **optimization**: Performance optimization analysis
10. **ui-design**: UI/UX design assistance

**Each server uses STDIO transport and absolute file paths.**

## üéØ **PROJECT OBJECTIVES**

### **Primary Goal**: 
Prove Claude Code can work with multiple MCP servers simultaneously for enhanced AI capabilities

### **Secondary Goals**:
- Document and solve the global vs local config issue
- Create reusable MCP server templates
- Establish best practices for MCP development

### **Success Metric**:
Claude Code session with all 10 MCP servers functional, performing real tasks across different domains

## üìö **DOCUMENTATION HIERARCHY**

**Read in this order:**
1. **START_HERE.md** (this file) - Current status and next steps
2. **MCP_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Common issues and solutions
3. **MCP_GLOBAL_CONFIG_CRITICAL.md** - Detailed global config explanation
4. **FINAL_MCP_PROOF.md** - Complete testing guide

**For Development:**
- **MCP_STDIO_REQUIREMENT.md** - Server development requirements

---

## üö® **IF THINGS AREN'T WORKING**

### **Problem**: MCP tools not available in Claude Code
**Solution**: 
1. Exit Claude Code completely
2. Run: `claude --mcp-config ~/.claude/claude_code_config.json`
3. Test: "Use memory tools to store test data"

### **Problem**: "Tool not found" errors
**Cause**: Session started without global config
**Solution**: Restart with global config (step above)

### **Problem**: Server connection errors
**Check**: Server logs should show "running on stdio" not "listening on port"
**Fix**: Convert HTTP servers to STDIO if needed

---

## üí™ **CONFIDENCE LEVEL**

**Technical Setup**: 90% confident - servers configured and logs show STDIO working
**Functional Testing**: 0% confident - need to prove with actual Claude Code session
**Documentation**: 70% confident - now covers critical issues clearly

**NEXT SESSION GOAL**: Get functional testing to 90% confidence by proving all 10 servers work end-to-end.

**SUMMARY: We have 10 MCP servers configured globally with STDIO transport. Now we need to prove they work functionally in a new Claude Code session.**
