## üÜò NEW DEVELOPER EMERGENCY KIT

**If the next developer is COMPLETELY LOST, follow this exact sequence:**

### Step 1: Get Project Running (5-minute test)
```bash
cd /Users/robertlee/GitHubProjects/Claude_MCPServer

# Test basic setup
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev

# Expected: Dev server starts on http://localhost:3000
# If this fails, you have dependency/config issues
```

### Step 2: Verify Current Session's Work
```bash
# What was supposed to be accomplished?
cat SESSION_NOTES.md | grep -A 5 "Primary Accomplishments"

# Did it actually work?
npm test  # Should pass
npm run build  # Should complete

# What's the current git state?
git status
git log -3 --oneline
```

### Step 3: Emergency Recovery
```bash
# If everything is broken, nuclear option:
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
git stash  # Save any work
git pull origin main  # Get latest
```

### Step 4: Evidence-Based Troubleshooting
1. **Check**: [Build Results](docs/command_outputs/build/session_build_results.md) - What failed?
2. **Check**: [Service Status](docs/command_outputs/services/session_end_services.md) - What's not running?
3. **Check**: [Git Changes](docs/command_outputs/git/session_end_status.md) - What was modified?
4. **Check**: SESSION_NOTES.md sections for specific issues encountered
